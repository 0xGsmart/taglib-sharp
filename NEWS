This is the first bug fix release for TagLib#. Fixes include:

	* Add JoinedAlbumArtists and FirstAlbumArtist for clarity.
	* Add Artist pointing to Performers with an ObsoleteAttribute.
	* Handle ID3v2 comments ending with text delimiters better.
	* Clear ID3v2 pictures when Pictures is set to null.
	* Don't try storing pictures larger than 64K in ASF files.
	* Don't throw an exception when saving MPEG-4 files without UTDA boxes.
	* Fix the clearing of MPEG-4 boxes.
	* Use Box.DataSize instead of Header.DataSize when calculating the
	MPEG-4 padding.
	* Recognize WMA Lossless in the codec description.

Outstanding bugs:
	* MPEG-4 tags do not show up in Nokia N95 Phone.
